    Churma, a traditional Rajasthani or Haryanvi sweet typically served along with Dal-Bati, is prepared by grinding or crushing baked or deep fried Bati into fine powder using a grinder and then thoroughly mixing it with melted ghee, sugar and dry-fruits. With the exception of salt not being added in the dough, Bati (aka Baati or Batti) for both Dal Bati and Churma is prepared in same way by either baking it in oven or deep frying it in Ghee.
